Snake Game

***

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have made the original snake game and I have added two types of food the snake can eat, one adds a point and the other takes away. The game works until a snake either bumps into a wall or eats enough red food to make the score = 0.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I need to make the red food (the one that takes away a point) to dissapear from the map in some interval of time, for example 7s, and be replaced with a green food.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have a problem with implementing time into my game in order to make the red food dissapear. I am encountering errors when trying different ways of completing this step.
