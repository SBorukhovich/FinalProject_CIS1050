The outcome of this project is a modified snake game that includes green,yellow, and red food options. 
The game is made using the pygame library which was completely unfamiliar to me before begining working on this proect. It was interesting to get a hang of Pygame.
The biggest difficulty I faced was writing the part where yellow and red food turn into green. Since the game is constanly updating to keep the snake running, it wasn't possible to use the sleep function that I've used before. Overall I am satisfied with the result as it is exactly what I intended.
If I would continue to modify my game, I would make the food constanly change. For example, yellow would turn to green in 3 seconds and then, if not eaten in time, it would turn back to yellow on so on untill eaten.
