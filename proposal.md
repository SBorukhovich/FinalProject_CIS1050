# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Rock Paper Scissors Game 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game where the user plays 'rock paper scissors' against the computer. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
My project is a game of rock paper scissors of user vs a computer. In the begining the user can chose how many rounds the game will go on for. My project is going to implement Turtle graphics in order to draw each move. Each move is going to be stored in a function with the name of the move. When the program starts it is going to ask the user to choose their move - Rock/Paper/Scissors. The chosen move is going to be drawn and then a random move is going to be drawn besides the user's to imitate the computer's choice. It will compare the two according to the rules of the game and add a point to the score of the player who won. If the user indicated more than one game, the program will clear the screen and ask the user to do another turn, and go on for as many rounds the user chose.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what I will have three functions that draw a rock,paper,scissors. I will be able to have the user input their prefered move and the program will draw it. I will be able to have the computer's choice drawn by using random function. I will have the program compare the two choices and indicate who won in that round.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Having a while loop for the number of rounds that the user indicated to loop the game for that certain amount. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

For me the best outcome would be when the program not only works according to my project design, but because it uses turtle graphics, the interface should also look interesting and clean. Also making the code readable and easy to follow.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to reaserch how to have the program freeze for a second or two in my project as I want to have some stops in the program's execution. I also need to know the command to clear the space where the turtle draws. Also reasearch some trutle comands like return back to a certain position as I don't quite remember them.
