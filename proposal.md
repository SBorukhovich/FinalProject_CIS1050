# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Snake Game 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game of snake where there is two options for food; one adds points, the other takes away.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
My project is a game of snake that is going to be done on python using either pygame or tkinter library. I want to start out with a classic snake game but to add more food options. I want the food to randomly appear on the canvas where the snake is and every time it appears it is either going to be greeen, which will add points if eaten, or a red one that will take a point away when eaten. I want the red food only to appear for a certain number of seconds (like 7s) and then it is going to dissapear and a green one will appear instead. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outome would be that the standart snake game executes. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome is when there is going to be two food options that one will add a point and the other will take away a point.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best option is when the red food appears (the one that takes away a point) it only appears for a certain number of seconds and then a green (adds points) one will appear instead.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to reaserch how to have the time function make the food appear for a fixed amount of seconds. I need to research more about Tkinter or Pygame as these are mostly used for making a game like 'snake'. I'll stick to one of those libraries and try learning how to use it. Also, in some tutorials I saw 'clases' used in python, I need to learn more about those.
